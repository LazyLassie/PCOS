This project is an attempt to develop a real-time object detection using machine learning concepts. The project aims to deliver an implemented approach to detect PCOS. Different machine learning algorithms like K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree and SVM with different kernel functions are used to predict PCOS from the identification of new genes. Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Classifier are used to develop an automated system that will act as an assisted tool for the doctor for saving considerable time in examining the patients and hence reducing the delay in diagnosing the risk of PCOS by using metabolic and clinical factors in a feature vector.
